## Preparing Your Bash Adventure

Before we set off on our coding journey, make sure you have these:

1. A command-line terminal (Bash)
2. An internet connection
3. Your excitement and curiosity

## Building the D&D Race Search Tool

1. **Summon the Magic of Curl:**

    Open your command-line terminal and let's cast our first spell to fetch D&D race information using the mighty `curl` command. Type or copy-paste the following:

    ```bash
    curl -L 'https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/races/dwarf' -H 'Accept: application/json'
    ```

    When you hit Enter, you'll unveil the details of the D&D Dwarf race!

2. **Create Your Own Spell (Bash Script):**

    Now, let's create a magical script named `dnd_race_search.sh` using your favorite text editor (like `nano`, `vim`, or even a code editor).

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Welcome to the D&D Race Search Tool!"
    echo "-----------------------------------"
    echo

    read -p "Enter the name of a D&D race: " race_name

    curl -L "https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/races/$race_name" -H 'Accept: application/json'
    ```

3. **Enchant Your Script:**

    Before you can use your script, you'll need to make it executable (aka runnable). In your terminal, type:

    ```bash
    chmod +x dnd_race_search.sh
    ```

4. **Embark on Your Quest:**

    Cast your spell and run your script:

    ```bash
    ./dnd_race_search.sh
    ```

    You'll be prompted to enter the name of a D&D race. For now, let's try "dwarf" and see what magnificent details unfold!

## The Mystical Output Awaits!

Prepare yourself, for the secrets of the D&D Dwarf race shall be revealed before your very eyes! Once you enter "dwarf," you should expect an awe-inspiring response similar to this:

```
Welcome to the D&D Race Search Tool!
-----------------------------------

Enter the name of a D&D race: dwarf

{
  "index": "dwarf",
  "name": "Dwarf",
  "speed": 25,
  "ability_bonuses": [
    {
      "ability_score": {
        "index": "con",
        "name": "CON",
        "url": "/api/ability-scores/con"
      },
      "bonus": 2
    }
  ],
  "alignment": "Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.",
  "age": "Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.",
  "size": "Medium",
  "size_description": "Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.",
  ...
  ...
}

```
