# Introduction

### :arrow_right: [Skip to the tutorials](/docs/tutorials/)

*If you wanna skip right into the tutorial, go ahead. We don't mind!*

### :wave: Welcome

Welcome to the D&D 5e SRD API, the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition API!

This documentation should help you familiarize yourself with the resources available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. Read through the [Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/) getting started section before you dive in.

Most of your problems should be solved just by reading through it.

### :lock: Authentication

This is a completely open API. **No authentication is required to query and get data**. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just `GET`-ing the data.

If you find a mistake in the data, feel free to [message us](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7)!

### :smile: Chat

Come hang out with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/TQuYTv7)! We're friendly and would love to hear what you make with the API!

### :handshake: Contribute

This API is built from two repositories:

- The repo containing the data lives here: https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-database
- The repo with the API implementation lives here: https://github.com/5e-bits/5e-srd-api

This is a evolving API and having fresh ideas are always welcome! You can
open an issue in either repo, open a PR for changes, or just discuss with
other users in this Discord.
