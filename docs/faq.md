# FAQ

### What is the SRD?

The SRD, or Systems Reference Document, contains guidelines for publishing content under the OGL. This allows for some of the data for D&D 5e to be open source. The API only covers data that can be found in the SRD. [Here's a link to the full text of the SRD.](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf)

### What is the OGL?

The Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license by Wizards of the Coast that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works. [More information about the OGL can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License)

### A monster, spell, subclass, etc. is missing from the API / Database. Can I add it?

Please check if the data is within the SRD. If it is, feel free to open an issue or PR to add it yourself. Otherwise, due to legal reasons, we cannot add it.

### Can this API be self hosted?

Yes it can! You can also host the data yourself if you don't want to use the API at all. You can also make changes and add extra data if you like. However, it is up to you to merge in new changes to the data and API.

### Can I publish is on `<insert platform>`? Is this free use?

Yes, you can. The API itself is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and the underlying data accessible via the API is supported under the SRD and OGL.
